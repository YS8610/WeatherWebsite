# a simple Weather website generated by Spring Boot  
  
The website consists of a input for user to key in the city which they are interested to get the weather information. Then the server will fetch info using openweather api and then display the info. Redis is also used to cache the search result for 5 min so that lesser call to openweather is needed.  
  
## Parameters needed  
In src\main\java\tfip\modserver\weatherwebsite\Constants.java, the openweather api key and redis server password are needed.  
in src\main\resources\application.properties, redis host and port are being configured.  

To run,  
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
